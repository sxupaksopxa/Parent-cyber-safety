# 🌿 Parent Cyber Safety AI — Frontend

This is the **frontend application** for *Parent Cyber Safety AI*, a gentle digital tool that helps parents understand how safe their child’s device and online activities are. The score reflects exposure to potential cyber threats (settings, online contacts, and habits). It is not a judgment of parenting or a prediction of harm. The goal is to offer gentle guidance and help families discover practical ways to keep children safer online.

The frontend is built with:

- **React 18**
- **Vite** (fast, modern dev environment)
- **TailwindCSS** for clean and accessible styling
- **Friendly UX** for sensitive topics involving children and digital well-being
